#### üåç Mission

The mission of the **Real-to-Sim-to-Real Framework** is to create tools and libraries that empower users to train their robots in **custom environments** tailored to their specific needs. The framework also enables users to **create their own environments** easily using just their **smartphone**. This mission aims to democratize access to robotics development, making it accessible to everyone, regardless of their expertise or resources.

#### üîë Why It Matters

This framework is significant because it allows **everyone**‚Äîfrom hobbyists to professionals‚Äîto train their robots for **custom tasks**, specific workflows, and various real-world applications. The ability to **create simulations on a smartphone** gives users the flexibility to design environments that closely match the tasks their robots need to perform. 

By making it easy to create and deploy robots for **real-world work** without requiring expensive hardware or specialized tools, we are opening up new possibilities in fields such as:

- **Robotics education**
- **Automated manufacturing**
- **Home automation**
- **Healthcare robots**

This framework ensures that **robotics development** is no longer limited to those with large budgets or advanced technical teams, but available to anyone with an idea.

#### üöÄ Key Features

### Environment Setup
- Simplified process to **load and configure Isaac Gym environments** tailored to your simulation needs.
  
### Data Collection
- Effortlessly **collect and store demonstration data** from the simulated environment for reinforcement learning tasks.

### Reinforcement Learning
- Use **GPU-accelerated reinforcement learning** methods to train policies that can be transferred to real-world robots.

### Teacher-Student Distillation
- **Transfer skills** from complex teacher models to simpler student models, making it easier to deploy advanced policies on real robots.

### Real-World Deployment
- Deploy your trained policies on **real robotic setups**, ensuring a smooth transition from simulated to real environments.
