title: GUI for real-to-sim-to-real
description:  Scan your room with your phone and convert it into a 3d environment.
---

The **GUI for Real-to-Sim-to-Real** is a user-friendly interface designed to simplify the process of creating, configuring, and exporting custom robot environments

This repository provides the official implementation of the RialTo GUI, as proposed in *Reconciling Reality through Simulation: A Real-to-Sim-to-Real approach for Robust Manipulation*
The manuscript is available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03949). See the [project page](https://real-to-sim-to-real.github.io/RialTo/)
