<Steps>

 1. Visit the GitHub Repository

    Each project in the OpenSource Sprint has a dedicated GitHub repository. You can find the link to the repository on the respective project page. Visit the GitHub repository to view the project code and track its progress.

2. Read the Contributing Guide

    Each repository has a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file, which contains the guidelines on how to contribute. These guidelines include:
    - Code standards and best practices
    - How to report bugs or suggest new features
    - Instructions on forking the repository and submitting pull requests
    - Licensing information

    Be sure to read the contributing guide to understand how to properly contribute to the project.

3. Fork and Clone the Repository

    To begin contributing:
    1. **Fork the repository**: Create your own copy of the repository by clicking the "Fork" button on the project’s GitHub page.
    2. **Clone your fork**: After forking, clone your repository to your local machine using the following command:
       ```bash
       git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
       ```
       Replace `your-username` and `your-repository` with the correct GitHub username and repository name.

4. Make Your Changes

    Once you’ve cloned the repository, you can start making changes to the codebase. Be sure to:
    - Follow the project’s coding conventions.
    - Address any open issues or add new features according to the project's roadmap.
    - Test your changes thoroughly before submitting.

5. Submit a Pull Request

    After making changes:
    1. Commit your changes with a meaningful commit message.
    2. Push your changes to your forked repository.
    3. Go to the original repository and submit a pull request.

    In the pull request, describe what you’ve done and why it improves the project. Be sure to reference any related issues.

6. Stay in Touch

    We encourage you to stay involved with the project after your first contribution. Monitor your pull requests and engage with maintainers or other contributors.
